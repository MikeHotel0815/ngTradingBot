## 📈 PERFORMANCE METRICS

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Command Polling** | 300ms | 50ms | **6x faster** |

---

## 📋 WHAT TO MONITOR

### 1. MT5 EA Logs
Check MT5 Terminal → Experts tab for:
```
✅ "50ms Command Polling - REAL-TIME!"
✅ "Command Latency: 25-50ms (REAL-TIME!)"
✅ No connection errors
```

### 2. Worker Logs
```bash
docker logs ngtradingbot_workers --tail 50 -f
```

Watch for:
- `✅ Executing signal: EURUSD` (when signal arrives)
- No `❌ Rejecting signal` errors for EURUSD
- No `paused` status messages

### 3. Dashboard
- Commands execute instantly
- EURUSD signals appear and trade
- Position updates in real-time

---

## 🔧 IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK

### Commands Still Slow?
1. Check MT5 EA is new version: Look for "50ms" in startup
2. Restart EA if needed
3. Check network latency: `ping 100.97.100.50`

### EURUSD Still Not Trading?
1. Check signal confidence ≥60%
2. Verify no other filters blocking (spread, max trades, etc.)
3. Run: `docker logs ngtradingbot_workers | grep EURUSD`

### Need to Rollback?
```bash
# Rollback git
git revert 44e8a59
git push origin master

# Rebuild containers
docker compose build --no-cache
docker restart ngtradingbot_workers
```
