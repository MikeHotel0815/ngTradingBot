## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Compile the EA
```bash
# In MetaEditor:
# Open: mt5_EA/Experts/ServerConnector.mq5
# Click: Compile (F7)
# Output: ServerConnector.ex5
```

### 2. Deploy to MT5
```bash
# Copy ServerConnector.ex5 to:
# C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal\[TERMINAL_ID]\MQL5\Experts\

# Or use the MetaEditor "Compile and Upload" feature
```

### 3. Restart EAs
1. Open MT5 Terminal
2. Remove old EA from charts
3. Drag new `ServerConnector.ex5` onto charts
4. Verify startup message shows: **"50ms Command Polling - REAL-TIME!"**

### 4. Test It!
1. Open Dashboard
2. Click "Open Trade" or any command button
3. **Command should execute instantly** (no visible delay)

## 🔍 Verification

Check EA startup logs in MT5 Terminal:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║      ngTradingBot EA - MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE MODE          ║
║  ⚡ 2-Second Heartbeat | 50ms Command Polling ⚡         ║
║  Expected Performance:                                   ║
║  • Command Latency: 25-50ms (REAL-TIME!)                ║
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

If you see **"50ms Command Polling - REAL-TIME!"** → ✅ Upgrade successful!
