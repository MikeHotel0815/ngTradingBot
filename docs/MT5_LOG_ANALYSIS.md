# MT5 Journal Log Analysis - 2025-10-10

## Summary
Analysis of MT5 ServerConnector EA logs from 18:50 to 19:24 on 2025-10-10.

## Key Findings

### 1. Trade Opening Failures - Error 4756 (Invalid Filling Mode)

**Affected Symbols:**
- **XAUUSD** (Gold): Multiple failures
- **DE40.c** (German DAX): Multiple failures
- **BTCUSD**: One failure (19:03:43), subsequent attempts successful

**Error Pattern:**
```
OrderSend failed with error: 4756 (Invalid filling mode / Wrong request structure)
```

The EA tries 3 filling modes in sequence:
1. Mode 0 (Fill-or-Kill / FOK)
2. Mode 1 (Immediate-or-Cancel / IOC)
3. Mode 2 (Return / Partial Fill)

**All 3 modes failing** indicates a broker-side issue, likely:
- Symbol trading is disabled/suspended
- Market is closed for these instruments
- Account restrictions on these symbols

### 2. Successful Trade Operations

**Opened Trades:**
- `16357474` - BTCUSD SELL 0.01 @ 19:00:11 (SL: 119222.14, TP: 116353.15)
- `16358791` - BTCUSD SELL 0.01 @ 19:15:15 (SL: 118990.66, TP: 116121.67)
- `16359162` - DE40.c BUY 0.3 @ 19:22:59 (SL: 24168.12, TP: 24371.93)

  - **Note**: Trade update failed with HTTP 500
- `16359162` - Closed @ 19:23:16 (Price: 24255.15)
  - Trade update sent successfully

### 3. Server Communication Issues

**HTTP 500 Errors (19:12:58 - 19:13:00):**
```
Tick batch send failed with code: 500
```
Multiple tick batches failed during a ~22 second window, indicating temporary server instability.

**HTTP 1001 Errors (Connection Issues):**
```
2025-10-10 19:13:15.275 - Tick batch send failed with code: 1001
2025-10-10 19:13:29.300 - Tick batch send failed with code: 1001
2025-10-10 19:13:43.320 - Heartbeat failed with code: 1001
```

Code 1001 indicates WebSocket "Going Away" - server restart or connection loss.

**404 Error (Missing Endpoint):**
```
2025-10-10 19:17:07,003 - [33mGET /api/performance/symbols HTTP/1.1[0m" 404
```
Confirms the Symbol Performance endpoint was missing on port 9900 (now fixed in code).

### 5. Trade 16337503 Investigation

**Not present in these logs** - This log file covers 18:50-19:24.

From previous investigation:
- Trade 16337503 closed at **18:22:09** (earlier than this log)
- Would need MT5 Journal logs from **18:00-18:30** to see closure event

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check Broker Symbol Status**
   - Verify XAUUSD trading hours and account permissions
   - Check if DE40.c has specific trading restrictions
   - Contact broker if error 4756 persists

2. **Investigate Server Instability**
   - The HTTP 500 errors at 19:12:58 suggest server overload or crash
   - Check server logs from that timeframe
   - Monitor database connection pool exhaustion

3. **Review Auto-Trading Logic**
   - Multiple duplicate commands being sent (same ID retried)
   - May indicate command queue not being properly cleared after failures

### Code Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add broker-specific error code handling
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Log detailed symbol properties when trades fail

2. **Symbol Validation**
   - Pre-validate symbols before sending OPEN_TRADE commands
   - Check trading hours and account permissions
   - Cache symbol properties to reduce API calls

3. **Connection Resilience**
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for HTTP 500 errors
   - Add connection health monitoring
   - Queue tick data during outages instead of dropping
